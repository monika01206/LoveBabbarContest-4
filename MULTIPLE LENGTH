Ninja is studying binary numbers and he likes binary numbers with maximum length.
He is having an array ‘A’ containing ‘N’ positive integers. He multiplies all the array elements and finds the maximum length binary number which is not greater than this product.
Can you tell the maximum length Ninja calculated.
Example :
N = 3
A = [ 1, 3, 4 ]

Explanation : 

The product of all array elements is 12.
The maximum length binary representation is 4 and one of such representations is 1010 as 10 <= 12.


CODE---
import java.math.BigInteger;
public class Solution {

  public static int multipleLength(int a[], int n) {
    // Write your code here.
      BigInteger prod = new BigInteger("1");
      long num;
      int count=0;
      for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
          prod= prod.multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(a[i]));
      //System.out.println(prod);
		String ans = prod.toString(2);
      return ans.length();
  }
}
