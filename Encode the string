You are given a string ‘S’ of length ‘N’. The string can be encoded using the following rules:
1) If the ‘i-th’ character is a vowel, change it to the next character in the alphabetical sequence. For example, the next character of ‘o’ is ‘p’.
2) If the ‘i-th’ character is a consonant, change it to the previous character in the alphabetical sequence. For example, the previous character of ‘h’ is ‘g’.
3) The next character of ‘z’ is ‘a’.
4) The previous character of ‘a’ is ‘z’.
Find the encoded string.
Example :
‘N’ = 4, ‘S’ = “code”

Character ‘c’ gets changed to ‘b’.
Character ‘o’ gets changed to ‘p’.
Character ‘d’ gets changed to ‘c’.
Character ‘e’ gets changed to ‘f’.

Encoded string = “bpcf”

CODE ----


class Solution {
  public static String encodeString(int n, String s) {
    // Write your code here.
    s = s.toLowerCase();
      String ans="";
      int val;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        char ch = s.charAt(i);
        if(ch=='a' || ch=='e'|| ch=='i'|| ch=='o'||ch=='u')
             val = ch+1;
        else
            val=ch-1;
        ans+=(char)val;
    }
      return ans;
  }
}
